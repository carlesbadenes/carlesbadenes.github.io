A few non-work-related things about myself:

* **Born on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea**. I grew up and went to college in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, which I think is a very beautiful and fascinating city.

* **Compulsive reader** A little bit of everything, including science fiction, fantasy, history, and drama. 
						
* **Avid music listener**. Also a little bit of everything, with emphasis on rock, blues, good pop, alt-country, and celtic music. 

* **I like some movies a lot**. Most of my favorite movies are classics, like 'The Quiet Man', 'The Searchers', or 'All About Eve'.

* **Art** I often participate in the Artist In Residence program at the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Here are some of the amazing artists that I have collaborated with:
	- [Danielle Bouchard](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/danielle-bouchard-stellar-companions)
	- [Kira Tsvetkova](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/kira-tsvetkova-rats-live-no-evil-star)
	- [Devon Tipp](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/devon-tipp-pale-blue-dot) 	
				
* **Carlos or Carles?** A lot of people ask me whether my name is Carlos or Carles. The answer is that it is <i>both</i>, it just depends on what language you are using. In Spanish, it is written Carlos and pronounced <b>[karlos]</b> (in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA">SAMPA</a> phonetic alphabet, 
here is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAMPA_chart">chart</a>). This is the version of my name that appears in my passport and all other official documents. 
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language">Catalan</a>, it is written Carles and pronounced **[karl@s]**. This is how most of my friends call me, and is the form that I use to sign scientific papers. But I answer to both. So now you know.
